Hey VPN is a HarmonyOS NEXT app written in ArkTS. The codebase uses the Stage
model, a VPN Extension Ability, a form-based control card, WorkScheduler,
ScanKit QR scanning, launcher shortcuts, `hey://` deep links, system share
import, and a native N-API bridge for the packaged proxy cores.

The main runtime is Xray. sing-box is also packaged and can be selected in
settings, but its app integration is intentionally narrower today.

## Current State

The Xray path is the production path in this repository. It supports VPN mode
and proxy-only mode, generates runtime Xray config from the selected profile,
starts/stops the HarmonyOS VPN Extension, and routes VPN traffic through the
packaged `libheytun2socks.so` adapter.

The current VPN data path for both cores is:

```text
HarmonyOS VPN TUN fd
  -> libheytun2socks.so
  -> 127.0.0.1:10810 (local SOCKS/mixed inbound)
  -> Xray or sing-box outbound
```

This is why the app does not hand the TUN fd directly to Xray or sing-box. The
OpenHarmony Go fork and TLSDESC build route are documented in
[`docs/harmonyos-go-tls-wall.md`](docs/harmonyos-go-tls-wall.md), and the native
build notes are in [`docs/building-native-cores.md`](docs/building-native-cores.md).

The sing-box path currently supports VPN mode with one converted outbound.
The converter accepts VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, AnyTLS, and TUIC, with
basic tcp/ws/grpc/http/httpupgrade transport mapping and none/tls/reality
security mapping. It does not yet support full configs, proxy chains, policy
groups, proxy-only mode, Hysteria2, WireGuard, SOCKS, HTTP, or sing-box-native
traffic stats.

## Implemented In Code

- HarmonyOS entry points: `EntryAbility`, `HeyVpnAbility`, `ControlCardAbility`,
  `SubscriptionUpdateWorkAbility`, launcher shortcuts, `hey://` routes, and
  `text/plain` system share import.
- Pages for server list, node detail/edit, import, JSON import, advanced
  outbound, subscriptions, subscription detail/edit, routing, settings,
  language, per-app proxy, assets, logs, scanner, backup, export, and about.
- Node and subscription handling: multiple subscription groups, selected group
  and node state, custom User-Agent, filters, pre/post profile fields, manual
  refresh, due refresh, WorkScheduler background refresh, search/sort/cleanup,
  and real delay testing through the native bridge.
- Imports: subscription URLs, v2rayN plain/base64 text, Xray outbound/full JSON,
  Clash-style YAML proxy entries, WireGuard config files, QR codes, system share
  text, and share links for `vless://`, `vmess://`, `trojan://`, `ss://`,
  `socks://`, `socks4://`, `socks5://`, `http://`, `https://`,
  `wireguard://`, `hysteria2://`, `hy2://`, `anytls://`, and `tuic://`.
- Exports: node share links for the protocols implemented by
  `formatOutboundJsonToShareLink`, QR generation on export/detail flows, routing
  rule JSON, and full local backup JSON.
- Xray runtime config: VPN SOCKS inbound for `tun2socks`, optional local
  SOCKS/HTTP proxy, proxy/direct/block outbounds, DNS settings, sniffing,
  mux, fragmentation/finalmask, Hysteria2 runtime shape, WireGuard IPv6
  handling, proxy chains, policy groups, metrics, and routing rules.
- Routing: traffic modes, domain strategy, LAN/CN/global/Iran/Russia/ad-block
  presets, custom rules, locked rules, process/port/network/protocol matchers,
  and rule import/export.
- Per-app proxy: allow/bypass mode plus stored package-name list. HarmonyOS NEXT
  does not expose a general global app enumeration path here, so manual or
  preset package entries remain part of the design.
- Assets and diagnostics: built-in geo source definitions, custom geo asset
  URLs, native geo data counting, runtime logs, core logs, optional speed
  display, persistent traffic totals, update checking, remote IP info, and
  English/Chinese plus additional language resources.
- Backup/restore: profile, subscription groups, settings, routing rules,
  per-app list, and custom asset URLs are exported as local JSON. Runtime
  traffic totals and control-card state are intentionally not migrated.

## Known Limits

- End-to-end VPN behavior still needs real-device coverage across more
  HarmonyOS NEXT devices and system versions. Some emulator/system images lack
  the VPN authorization component.
- sing-box is a preview runtime in the app: it is packaged and selectable, but
  the app only starts it for VPN mode with a single supported outbound.

## Build And Install

`build-profile.json5` is a local DevEco Studio file and is ignored by Git because
it may contain personal signing material. Before opening a fresh checkout, copy
`build-profile.example.json5` to `build-profile.json5`, then configure debug or
release signing in DevEco Studio on your own machine. Keep certificate paths, key
passwords, and other signing material local.

The app is configured for HarmonyOS target SDK `6.0.1(21)` and compatible SDK
`5.1.1(19)`. The project smoke-test script wraps `hvigorw` and `hdc`.

Build the signed HAP:

```bash
./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh build
```

If DevEco Studio is not in the default macOS location, pass the SDK/tool paths:

```bash
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk \
HVIGOR=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/tools/hvigor/bin/hvigorw \
./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh build
```

The expected output is:

```text
entry/build/default/outputs/default/entry-default-signed.hap
```

Useful device commands:

```bash
./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh targets
./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh doctor
./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh install
./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh logs
```

## Native Libraries

`libheyvpn.so` is built from `entry/src/main/cpp/napi_init.cpp`. CMake then
copies the packaged Go shared libraries into the HAP native library directory:

| Library | Current role | Build status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `libxray.so` | Main Xray runtime; exports start/stop, ping, and stats entry points. | Scripted by `scripts/build_libxray_ohos.sh`. |
| `libsingbox.so` | Optional sing-box runtime; exports start/stop/version/probe entry points. | Scripted by `scripts/build_libsingbox_ohos.sh`. |
| `libheytun2socks.so` | Relays the HarmonyOS VPN TUN fd into the core's local inbound. | Packaged and used; built by `scripts/build_tun2socks_ohos.sh`. |

Both scripted Go builds use the OpenHarmony Go fork with `GOOS=openharmony`.
Keep the fork toolchain outside the repository; `hvigor clean` removes the
repository `build/` directory.
