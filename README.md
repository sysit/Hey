Hey VPN is a HarmonyOS VPN client built with ArkTS, Stage model abilities,
and a native Xray core. It imports proxy nodes and subscriptions,
generates an Xray runtime config, starts a HarmonyOS VPN Extension, and routes
the device TUN flow through Xray's native TUN inbound.

The current native path is:

```text
User connects
  -> vpnExtension.startVpnExtensionAbility(...)
  -> HeyVpnAbility.onCreate(want)
  -> vpnExtension.createVpnConnection(context)
  -> vpnConnection.create(vpnConfig)
  -> TUN fd
  -> libheyvpn.so dlopen(libxray.so)
  -> CGoSetTunFd(tunFd)
  -> CGoRunXrayFromJSON(config)
  -> Xray native TUN inbound reads the Harmony VPN fd
  -> Xray outbound
```

## Status

The client is feature-complete across the UI and config layers: node and
subscription management, share-link and JSON import, Xray config generation,
native delay testing, routing, geo-asset management, per-app proxy, and the
full VPN extension startup path are all implemented and wired to the native
bridge. The remaining gap is end-to-end traffic validation, which should be
done on a real HarmonyOS device because some emulator/system images do not
include the VPN authorization component.

## Download

Signed HAP packages are published on the
[**Releases**](https://github.com/popsiclelmlm/Hey/releases) page. Grab the
latest `entry-default-signed.hap` and install it with DevEco Studio or `hdc`
(see [Install And Test](#install-and-test)). Building from source is covered
below.

> Note: the UI and config layers are feature-complete; end-to-end VPN traffic
> should be validated on a real HarmonyOS device (see Status).

## Features

- HarmonyOS Stage app with `EntryAbility` and `HeyVpnAbility`, plus core VPN routing, config, and sharing flows.
- Node list, search, selection, start/stop/restart controls, and runtime status.
- Import of subscription URLs, Xray outbound JSON, and share links, with
  multi-subscription groups and per-node detail/edit pages.
- Share-link parsing for `vless://`, `vmess://`, `trojan://`, `ss://`,
  `socks://`, `http(s)://`, `wireguard://`, and `hysteria2://` / `hy2://`.
- Xray config generation with native TUN inbound plus proxy/direct/block
  outbounds, and routing rules (bypass LAN/CN).
- Native N-API bridge for packaged `libxray.so`, including TUN fd setup,
  Xray lifecycle entry points, and real per-node delay testing (`CGoPing`).
- Geo-asset management (geoip/geosite download, custom URLs, and status/count feedback).
- Per-app proxy with allow/deny modes, a preset app list, and manual package
  entry (HarmonyOS NEXT restricts global app enumeration).
- Scan/import and export pages, diagnostic log panel, native runtime stat
  display, settings, and an about page — with full English/Chinese i18n.

docs/                             Real-device test documentation
```

## Requirements

- DevEco Studio / HarmonyOS SDK 6.1.1, API 24.
- A HarmonyOS phone or tablet for end-to-end VPN testing.
- Go and DevEco native toolchains when rebuilding the Xray shared library.

## Build

Build the app with the project smoke-test script:

```bash
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk ./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh build
```

The output HAP is expected at:

```text
entry/build/default/outputs/default/entry-default-signed.hap
```

Rebuild the Xray native core when needed:

```bash
./scripts/build_libxray_ohos.sh
```

The script places `libxray.so` and `libxray.h` under
`entry/src/main/cpp/prebuilt/arm64-v8a/`.

## Install And Test

List connected targets:

```bash
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk ./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh targets
```

Install the HAP:

```bash
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk ./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh install
```

Watch VPN and native bridge logs:

```bash
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk ./scripts/device_vpn_smoke_test.sh logs
```

## Native Core

The native bridge builds `libheyvpn.so` and loads one packaged Go shared
library, `libxray.so`. That library exports Xray control symbols plus
`CGoSetTunFd`, documented in
[`entry/src/main/cpp/README.md`](entry/src/main/cpp/README.md).

Hey VPN does not bundle or invoke `tun2socks` for the VPN data path. HarmonyOS
creates the VPN TUN fd, `libheyvpn.so` passes that fd into Xray with
`CGoSetTunFd`, and the generated runtime config uses Xray's native
`protocol: "tun"` inbound. A local SOCKS inbound may still be generated for
per-node delay tests, but it is separate from VPN traffic forwarding.

## Roadmap

- Real-device VPN traffic validation across more HarmonyOS versions.
- Node sorting, duplicate cleanup, and automatic subscription refresh.
- Camera-based QR scanning and QR code generation for share/export.
- Protocol editors for advanced VLESS/VMess/Trojan/Shadowsocks/WireGuard/
  Hysteria2 fields, plus TUIC support.
- Expanded routing rulesets, including ad-blocking and custom rule editing.
- HarmonyOS deep-link import, shortcuts, and platform-specific automation.
